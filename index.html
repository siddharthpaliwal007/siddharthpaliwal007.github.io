          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently enrolled as a student at the University Of Windsor, Canada pursuing a graduate degree. I am majoring in Master of Applied Computing (MAC) for the Winter 2021 Term. I have previous experience in Blockchain Development at an IT company and also worked as a Research Assistant in Management at IIMA for a year. Talking about the undergraduate, I had completed B.E. Degree in Computer from the LDRP Institute of Technology and Research, Gandhinagar.

          <h3 class="text-center">HOW I DECIDED TO GO IN THE DIRECTIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY</h3>
          <p>
            As a young kid, when I saw my father, an IT professional, typing away on his laptop and engrossed in his work, I was curious to know what it was about this black box that had his attention. Like any child, possessing immense curiosity, I too waded my way to my father’s lap and bombarded him with questions on; What was he doing? What is this box? What does it do?, etc. And I very clearly remember my father laughing softly and patiently answering my questions in the simplest manner possible. Needless to say, I was very much impressed by that black box’s capabilities, especially on realizing that it had games that I could play with. Over the years, as I explored the wide-ranging functionality of this box, it was no longer a black box to me, but rather a cleverly designed system programmed to perform specific tasks. I used to ace my computer examinations and often attended technology-related seminars to understand the rapid development going on in the industry. I was particularly drawn towards understanding how these manifold computer applications were designed and developed.
